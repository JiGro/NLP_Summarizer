### NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP): WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
**Natural language processing (NLP)** is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

NLP can also have significant impact in the business environment. Since the personal performance of each employee is the bedrock of business productivity and success, correctly applied **NLP can** improve staff confidence and morale, **increase team performance and productivity and in turn improve customer satisfaction**.

### PROJECT INTENTION
This .py script is my first approach to text processing. By utilizing the NLTK library in combination with a Wikipedia api library and a basic math algorithm, a given input text will be summarized. The threshold variable allows for adjustment of the summary length. The higher the threshold, the fewer words make the cut. I found the threshold of 1.3 to work perfectly.

The following sections might include code snippets in order to allow following my thought process. However, steps have been cut out. For detailed code refer to .py file.

### 1.) CREATING A FREQUENCY TABLE

First, the user will be asked to provide a search query for Wikipedia. After that, the user can choose between all linked Wikipedia articles to generate the summary as wished.
```
input_str = input("What summary from Wiki do you wish to receive?")
input_list = wikipedia.search(input_str)
print(input_list)
print("Which page do you want?")
response = ''
while response not in input_list:
    response = input("Please copy from list above without quotes and paste here: ")
```

Example string from Wikipedia for the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique:

_**The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for \'tomato\', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThere are six steps in the original technique:\n\nDecide on the task to be done.\nSet the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).\nWork on the task.\nEnd work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.\nIf you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3â€“5 minutes), then go to step 2.\nAfter four pomodoros, take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is the interval of time spent working.Regular breaks are taken, aiding assimilation. A short (3â€“5 minutes) rest separates consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. A longer (15â€“30 minute) rest is taken between sets.A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible; when interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed (using the inform â€“ negotiate â€“ schedule â€“ call back strategy) or the pomodoro must be abandoned.After task completion in a pomodoro, any time remaining could be devoted to activities such as:\n\nReview and edit the work that you just completed\nReview the list of upcoming tasks for the next planned pomodoro time blocks, and start reflecting on or updating those tasks\nComplete some administration or "paper shuffling" tasks that can be done quickly and do not require concentration\nReview the activities from a learning point of view - what did I learn? What could I do better or differently?\nExit this pomodoro time blockThe stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing are fundamental to the technique. In the planning phase, tasks are prioritized by recording them in a "To Do Today" list. This enables users to estimate the effort tasks require. As pomodoros are completed, they are recorded, adding to a sense of accomplishment and providing raw data for subsequent self-observation and improvement.\n\n\n== Tools ==\nThe creator and his proponents encourage a low-tech approach, using a mechanical timer, paper, and pencil. The physical act of winding the timer confirms the user\'s determination to start the task; ticking externalises desire to complete the task; ringing announces a break. Flow and focus become associated with these physical stimuli.The technique has inspired application software for several platforms.\n\n\n== Variations ==\nThere are many variations on the Pomodoro Technique. These allow individuals to tailor the principles of the Pomodoro Technique to better suit their personal working style. \nSome variations include:\n\nWork in 90 minute time periods. Rather than a 25 minute focus period, work in 90 minute blocks. This reflects a natural concentration cycle.\nWork in natural time periods. There may be natural time markers in your life - for example the period between meetings, or the time until your kids or partner come home, or the time until the dishwasher finishes. Use these to define focus periods.\nFlowtime. Monitor your natural productivity periods, and from this data work out the best productivity system for yourself.All of these approaches preserve the core Pomodoro Technique principle of working in specific time blocks - but they adjust the periods to better suit individual needs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProcrastination\nLife hacking\nIncremental reading\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPomodoro Method**_

First, we dissect the input string / text and create a list of single word snippets, excluding stop words of the English language. 

```
{'the': 7,
 'pomodoro': 12,
 'techniqu': 8,
  ...
 'applic': 1,
 'sever': 1,
 'platform': 1}

```

***
### 2.) CREATING A SENTENCE LIST
We utilize NLTK's sent_tokenize() function to split the input text into full sentences. This will help us in further calculate the sentence scores.

```shell
['The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo[1] in the late 1980s.',
 'The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.',
  ...
 'Flow and focus become associated with these physical stimuli.',
 'The technique has inspired application software for several platforms.']
```

***
### 3.) OUTPUT DICTIONARY WITH SCORE FOR EACH SENTENCE 
Next, we loop through the entire sentence list from 2.). We now select the first 10 characters of each sentence and check for matches in the frequency table from 1.). Finally, we generate a final score for each sentence by floor dividing the frequencies by the word count.

```shell
{'The Pomodoro Te': 3,
 'The technique u': 4,
 'Each interval i': 3,
  ...
 'The creator and': 3,
 'The physical ac': 2,
 'Flow and focus ': 4}
 ```
 
***
### 4.) CALCULATION OF AVERAGE SENTENCE SCORE
We calculate the average sentence score by adding up all individual scores and diving through the length of the sentence list

```shell
avgScore
Out: 4
 ```
 
***
### 5.) SUMMARY GENERATOR
In the last step, we use the defined threshold variable to identify those sentences that make the cut. These will be added to the summary string, which will then be printed out. 

```shell
Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes). Work on the task. A short (3â€“5 minutes) rest separates consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. Some variations include: Work in 90 minute time periods. Rather than a 25 minute focus period, work in 90 minute blocks. Work in natural time periods. Use these to define focus periods. Flowtime.
